# Example of using CGAL in Python using PyBind11 and skbuild_conan

This is a minimal example of how to use CGAL in Python using PyBind11 and skbuild_conan.
It provides CGAL via a custom conan recipe.

Just run `pip install .` to install the package.

It just binds CGAL polygons with the EPEC-kernel, but does not do anything with it.
