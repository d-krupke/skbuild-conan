    name="simple_skbuild_conan_example",
    version="0.1.0",  # TODO: Use better approach for managing version number.
    # ~~~~~~~~~~~~ CRITICAL PYTHON SETUP ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    # This project structures defines the python packages in a subfolder.
    # Thus, we have to collect this subfolder and define it as root.
    packages=find_packages("src"),  # Include all packages in `./src`.
    package_dir={"": "src"},  # The root for our python package is in `./src`.
    python_requires=">=3.7",  # lowest python version supported.
    install_requires=[
        # requirements necessary for basic usage (subset of requirements.txt)
    ],
    # ~~~~~~~~~~~ CRITICAL CMAKE SETUP ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    # Especially LTS systems often have very old CMake version (or none at all).
    # Defining this will automatically install locally a working version.
    cmake_minimum_required_version="3.23",
    #
    # By default, the `install` target is built (automatically provided).
    # To compile a specific target, use the following line.
    # Alternatively, you can use `if(NOT SKBUILD) ... endif()` in CMake, to
    # remove unneeded parts for packaging (like tests).
    # cmake_install_target = "install"
    #
    # In the cmake you defined by install(...) where to move the built target.
    # This is critical als only targets with install will be used by skbuild.
    # This should be relative paths to the project root, as you don't know
    # where the package will be packaged. You can change the root for the
    # install-paths with the following line. Note that you can also access
    # the installation root (including this modification) in cmake via
    # `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`. If your package misses some binaries, you
    # probably messed something up here or in the `install(...)` path.
    # cmake_install_dir = ".",
    # |-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
    # | If you are packing foreign code/bindings, look out if they do install |
    # | targets in global paths, like /usr/libs/. This could be a problem.    |
    # |-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
    #
    # Some CMake-projects allow you to configure it using parameters. You
    # can specify them for this Python-package using the following line.
    #cmake_args=[]
    # There are further options, but you should be fine with these above.
